    "As you probably know by now, BERT is a transformed-based, context-sensitive, neural language models that has been trained, among others, on a masked language modeling task, where the model learns to predict what the most likely word is at a a *masked* (hidden) position in the sentence. In a sentence like:\n",
    "\n",
    ">There were several [MASK] with the proposed solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "the model will learn that the word *problems* or *issues* is more likely at this position than the word *unicorns* or *days*. The model uses both the right and left context of the masked position to make its predictions. Models trained to maximize the probability of predicting the correct masked words learn to represent a good amount of linguistic knowledge as a result of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **probe** is a test of a language model aimed at investigating how accurate these predictions are, especially for cases where syntax makes it quite clear that one (form of a) word is correct, and another word is impossible. In the example above, for instance, the masked position can be filled by a plural noun (*problems*) but not by a singular noun (*problem*). If the model makes predictions that respect the linguistic constraints, we have reason to believe that the model is somehow aware of the linguistic structure of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "While predicting whether the masked position should be filled by a singular or plural noun seems easy in the example above (both *were* and *several* are good predictors of plural), we can try to make the task harder by looking for contexts where the solution requires more careful *attention* to the right words in the context\n",

    ">\n",
    ">There were some unexpected and unforeseen [MASK] with the proposed solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the examples above, the task is made harder by replacing *several* (which is always followed by a plural noun) by *some* (which can be followed by a singular or a plural noun), by replacing *were* (which always heads a sentence with a plural subject) by *could be* (which can head a sentence with a singular or plural subject), and by inserting material between the verb *were* (which indicates that there should be a plural) and the MASK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a grammatical phenomenon in a language of your choice, and come up with at least 5 example sentences to probe whether the model makes the correct predictions. Think of cases where the context makes it clear that the mask has to be plural or singular, that a verb has to have a particular form (like plural or singular, or participle or infinitive), that a specific (personal, possessive, reflexive) pronoun has to be used, that an adjective or noun has to have a specific inflection (like in German and more generally in languages with a rich case and/or gender marking system). There is a host of literature on this, see for instance [Marvin and Linzen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09031) (for English) and [Sahin et al](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/coli_a_00376) (for multilingual probes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we will be using for this task is the [multilingual BERT](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) model mBERT, that was trained on the Wikipedia text of the 102 largest Wikipedia's. This means that you do not have to choose examples from English, but that you may also present a probe for another language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following loads the pipeline for doing masked prediction, and load the mBERT model (this may take a minute or so). You can ignore the warning about some weights not being initialized. The pipeline can be used to test masked language model prediction. Given a sequence containing the special token [MASK], the model will predict what the most likely tokens are at that position, using both left and right context."

    "### Answer\n",
    "A common mistake in Dutch is to use the word \"als\" instead of \"dan\" in a comparison where the subjects are not equal. Take for example the sentence \"Maarten is stronger than Peter\". \"Maarten is sterker als Peter\" is incorrect, and \"Maarten is sterker dan Peter\" is correct. In fact, the use of \"als\" instead of \"dan\" is always incorrect in such a comparison. The use of \"als\" in a comparison is however correct when the subjects are equal. Take for example the sentence \"Maarten is as strong as Peter\". In Dutch this would for example be \"Maarten is even sterk als Peter\". So \"als\" is correct in the second type of comparison, but not in the first type. Unfortunately, these cases are mixed up quite often.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of probes was constructed to test whether mBERT correctly uses \"dan\" instead of \"als\" in unequal comparisons. The probes contained two different types of subjects to be compared: the pronouns \"jij\" (you) and \"ik\" (I/me), and the colours \"paars\" (purple) and \"groen\" (green). Four different adjectives were used: \"sterker\" (stronger), \"levendiger\" (more vibrant), \"slimmer\" (smarter), and \"helderder\" (brighter). Complexity was introduced by using an adjective that is uncommonly used in describing a given subject. E.g. \"slim\" is not really an adjective one would use to describe a colour. Still, even if the meaning makes less sense, it would be expected that \"dan\" is used instead of \"als\". Complexity was also introduced by making sentences longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarkably, mBERT gives the correct answer in only four out of twelve probes. For sentences about colours, mBERT's mistakes are in the relatively more complex case of \"slimmer\", and the longer sentences. For the comparisons containing pronouns, mBERT is incorrect not only in the relatively more complex cases of \"levendiger\" and \"helderder\", but also in the simple case of \"sterker\". Additionally, it is incorrect in the cases of longer sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is unclear why mBERT has such a poor performance in selecting the correct word, even in relatively simple cases. Namely, given that it was trained on Wikipedia texts, it is unlikely that it has seen a lot of examples of \"als\" incorrectly being used in an unequal comparison."

    "\n",
    "The Model Hub of HuggingFace is home to a staggering amount of models for the more disparate use-cases, but you may have noticed that many of those are trained on the English language. Let's consider for example the [`UnifiedQA`](https://github.com/allenai/unifiedqa) model by AllenAI, which is a T5 model architecture trained to perform question answering on multiple formats (e.g. extract the answer from the provided context, produce an answer without a supporting context, choose among multiple possible answers, yes/no questions) using a unified text-to-text approach. While this opens thrilling perspectives in having a single model for all QA use-cases, UnifiedQA models are available for English only, and training such models from scratch in another language would require nontrivial effort and resources.\n",
